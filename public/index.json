We offer a multi-resolution multi-task (MRGP) framework that allows for both inter-task and intra-task multi-resolution and multi-fidelity. We develop shallow Gaussian Process (GP) m ixtures that approxim ate the difficult to estimate joint likelihood with a composite one and deep GP constructions that naturally handle biases. In doing so, we generalize existing approaches and offer information-theoretic corrections and efficient variational approximations. We demonstrate the competitiveness of MRGPs on synthetic settings and on the challenging problem of hyper-local estimation of air pollution levels across London from multiple sensing modalities operating at disparate spatio-temporal resolutions.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-resolution Multi-Task Gaussian Procceses","type":"publication"}]
