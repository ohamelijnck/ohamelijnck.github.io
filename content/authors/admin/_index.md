I am a first year PhD student at the Alan Turing Institute and the University of Warwick supervised by [Theodoros Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/). I am part of the [London air quality project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/london-air-quality) at the Turing and the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io). My research interests lie in scalable inference methods for spatio-temporal Bayesian methods such as Gaussian Processes.
